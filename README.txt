Wordpress Plugin for generating social content via a shortcode

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to use the shortcode syntax: [twitter title="Title For Tweets" user="YOUR_TWITTER_HANDLE" count="5"] to output tweets in a page or theme. It currently only supports Twitter, but  Github and Dribbble are soon to follow, along with any explicit requests.

The Twitter API PHP wrapper was created by James Mallison under an MIT License. Download the library at: http://github.com/j7mbo/twitter-api-php

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
